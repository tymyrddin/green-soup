# PTES

The Penetration Testing Execution Standard (PTES) is a methodology for performing penetration tests.

[PTES](http://www.pentest-standard.org/index.php/Main_Page) (NO HTTPS!) breaks the penetration test down into seven phases:
preengagement interactions, intelligence gathering, threat modeling, vulnerability analysis, exploitation,
post-exploitation, and reporting.
