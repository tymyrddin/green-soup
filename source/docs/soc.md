# SOC

A SOC (Security Operations Center) is a team that continuously monitors and analyses the security state and procedures 
and of an organisation. The team defends against security breaches and actively isolates and mitigates security risks.

Most SOC teams are fighting fires with never enough staff, never enough time, and never enough visibility or 
certainty about what is going on. 

Focus on [consolidating the toolset](blue:index), and [effectively organising the teams](purple:docs/soc/README).
